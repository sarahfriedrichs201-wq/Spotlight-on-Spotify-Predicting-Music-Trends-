Project Summary: 
The music industry has undergone a seismic shift in the digital era, with streaming platforms like Spotify serving as key indicators of a song’s success. Understanding how musical attributes influence popularity can provide critical insights for artists, producers, and streaming platforms. This study explores a dataset comprising the most-streamed Spotify tracks to examine relationships between musical characteristics (e.g., danceability, valence, energy) and popularity, measured by the number of streams. Given the non-normality of streaming data, nonparametric methods were employed to ensure robust analysis.
The analysis began with data cleaning and preliminary exploration of the statistical behavior of the explanatory variable to identify any abnormalities and validate underlying assumptions. When necessary, transformations were used to address skewness in variables like acousticness and speechiness. Normality and the fitting of distributions were assessed using goodness-of-fit tests, including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Anderson-Darling test, and QQ-plots. Additionally, the similarity of distributions after segmenting the data by year was tested using the Smirnov test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Next,  Friedman test was applied to evaluate differences in distributions across musical attributes, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to identify specific attribute discrepancies. Theil-Sen regression further quantified the effects of attributes like danceability and valence on streams, revealing significant negative relationships. Spearman correlations provided complementary insights, albeit showing weak overall monotonic trends.
The results underscore how higher levels of speechiness or danceability may detract from mainstream appeal, while tonal key also influences performance. These findings highlight the nuanced relationship between song features and audience preferences, offering valuable guidance for optimizing music production and marketing strategies. Future research could expand by analyzing genre or listener demographics to build a more holistic model of musical success.
